# Godot_audio_load_bug
 sample project of possible GDScript bug


# Instructions to reproduce the bug:
 1) open project
 2) record audio (it automatically loads it into Player.tscn for playing)
 3) Play doesn't work (just saved audio file doesn't work - BUG?)
 4) "Alt+Tab" twice to go back into program allows for load(path) to work (press LoadFile button) and audio file works
